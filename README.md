### Better private Key Management

For example if we feel nervous to put private key to .env file <br>
thinking that we accidentally push it to github <br>
So what we can do we can add private key in our RPC URL <br>

as our environment variables right in the command line <br>

If we use it in our .env file we can encrypt it  <br>
 and store our encrypted key locally <br>

 Now in that way if somebody does get into our account <br>

 our private key is not sitting in plain text <br>
 It is encrypted and to decrypt it requires password <br>

 which only we know <br>
